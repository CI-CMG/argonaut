Hi Ryan,

Thanks! The work you described sounds great and reasonable. Getting account access is critical for the work. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help. 

Regarding the actual development work, here is the Argo GADC cookbook https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00351/46202/. This cookbook listed the procedures of required data processing, which will be useful for our future OISS work planning. 

I am working on getting the data from Argo DACs. Hope we can get some example data files from the AOML US DAC. 

Best,
Zhankun

Hello Zhankun,

Thank you for the information about Tim, I was unsure whether he took a break or retired.

I hope things are doing well for him.

 

By coincidence, I had a meeting this afternoon with Megan Scanderbeg who confirmed that the plan was to setup an NCEI Argo GDAC.

And we decided to update the “Argo GDAC cookbook” https://doi.org/10.13155/46202 to facilitate that process.

 

I can already provide the link to the Argo format checker that accept/reject files received from GDAC.

https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoFormatChecker

 

The multi-profile files (including the S files) are generated by a matlab script.

We should probably make it available on Github with its compiled version (a java code that do not need a matlab licence)

 

The ideal situation would be a GDAC in a container, activated on both sides of the Atlantic.

Best regards,

 

Thierry

Hi Thierry,

Thank you for getting back to me so quickly! And thanks for sharing the Argo GDAC cookbook and the format checker. 

matlab probably will be problematic for us to use. A complied version might work better. I wonder if the matlab code can be shared with us. We will check to see if that can be converted to python or some other languages. 

Yes, running the codes in a container will be ideal and our goal here is to run the GDAC in a container in a cloud environment. 

More to discuss later...

Best,
Zhankun

We probably have access to a Matlab licence, but can we convert it so that is not required?
